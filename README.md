# Aloe You

Aloe you is going to be a house plant e-commerce site. I'm building it so I can practice using these technologies:

- React
- Tailwind
- Firebase
- Redux
- GraphQL
- Hooks
- Stripe

## So Far...

The following has been built:

- Start of the homepage
- Login/Signup page
- Start of the shop page using shop data filling in the item cards
- Firebase sign up
- Firebase Google auth
- Firebase login
- Basket Dropdown
- Basket Page
- Add products to basket
- Stripe
- Netlify

TODO not limited to:
[] Improve UI
[] Improve mobile
[] Handle loading
[] Handle ability to submit payment twice
[] Add loading/disable additional clicks
[] Add payment form validation instead of alerts
[x] Fix stripe auth error with secret key
[] Handle routing differently for categories
[] Add confirmation product was added to the basket
[] Separate firebase utils into separate files
[] Set basketItems to null when logout


Please check back for progress.
